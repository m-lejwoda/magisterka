# Contour generator algorithm. 

## Technology stack

#### C++ :)
#### LibLas

## Application description

This is an algorithm that allows user to generate contours from a .las file. Those files are extracted from lidar scans. In a nutshell, it is a point cloud where each point has some data like XYZ values. The algorithm includes omp functions that allow you to run applications on multiple processor threads, so you can make measurements and observations.
